This module provides named enumerations for python.

Unlike other implementations that I have seen, this is *not* an anonymous
enumeration. To use it derive from the Enumeration class provided in
enum.py and list the names of the enum members in the class member _enum_.

The enum is itself a singleton class. It tries to be immutable via
__slots__ and by refusing to allow its members to be changed.

Enum members are an integer subclass with a "name" property and that
knows how to pretty print itself. The enum values are interchangeable
with integers, which may or may not be what you want.

The class supports membership ("FOO in MyEnum") and mapping a
non-instance-member value to a name. (I.e. if FOO uses the integer value
1, then MyEnum.name(1) returns "FOO".)

Tested on 2.4.6, 2.5.2, 2.6.2, on a combination of debian sarge, etch,
lenny, and ubuntu 9.04.

There are obvious capabilities that could be added but this does all
that I need so far. Patches will be happily accepted.
